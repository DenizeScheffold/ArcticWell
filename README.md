Note: this project is designed to be displayed in 376x736, but should look fine on most phones. It will however likely look wonky if viewed on desktop resolutions.


To see code related to project, please go to next-project/arctic-well. New developing branch for each sprint, see related week to get to know 
the code we work on as for today. Every friday (releaseday after sprint) branch is merged to main, hence updates the website.
